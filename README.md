ohdiotomp3.py podcast convertion utility script

This script is used to convert mp4 audio track to mp3 so that old mp3 player can read them.

The script won't delete or cleanup your files.

**Usage:**

python3 ohdiotomp3.py from your current mp4 directory

or

python3 ohdiotomp3.py --sourcedir **dir**

or

using ffmpeg directly

ffmpeg -i file.mp4 file.mp3

**Requirements**
* [python3](https://www.python.org/) (tested with python 3.6.9)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in your path


I prepared a tutorial video to learn how to do that on Windows 10:
